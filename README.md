## Package definition
RRLab is a growing collection of experimental techniques and quality-of-life tools born from years of hands-on data science, modeling, and exploration. Built as a personal lab bench in R, it reflects a constant search for better ways to understand high-dimensional data, test bold ideas, and streamline the grind of daily analysis. The main interesting functions are `RRFE` and `KDEA`! Best QOL function is `libraryR`!

## Function examples
#### RR-Feature extraction (RRFE)
This algorithm evaluates each possible combination of contrasts (generated by PCA) and applies seeded knn per contrast to identify the best contrast which achieved the highest classification accuracy. Then the resulted contrast is resulted and the most important features are extracted (based on this contrast).

[See the example and results](/docs/Functions/RRFE.md) 


#### Leave-p-Out Cross-Validation Differential Expression Analysis (KDEA or LpO CV DEA)
This algorithm randomly resamples the original dataset using only 80% of all samples for K folds. Each fold is processed using limma, Pvalues and LogFC is generated and stored. Median LogFC and amount of significant ocurrences are ranked and combined to a combined rank. An image is generated indicative of the variation and significance based on the collective DEA results. The Ranked features are resulted and the robust features from the image are resulted in a list.

[See the example and results](/docs/Functions/KDEA.md) 

#### RR general characteristics of data scan (RRscan)
This function will evaluate all distribution properties per feature and per sample. Also detects potential outliers based on hclust, mean+sd, var+sd(var).

[See the example and results](/docs/Functions/RRscan.md)
