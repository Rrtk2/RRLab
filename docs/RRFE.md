#### RRFE (RR-Feature extraction)
This algorithm evaluates each possible combination of contrasts (generated by PCA) and applies seeded knn per contrast to identify the best contrast which achieved the highest classification accuracy. Then the resulted contrast is resulted and the most important features are extracted (based on this contrast).

An example:
```
RRtest::RRFE(iris,5)
```
