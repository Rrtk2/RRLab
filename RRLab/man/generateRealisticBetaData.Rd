\arguments{
\item{n_features}{Integer. Number of features (CpGs) to simulate. Default is 1000.}

\item{n_samples}{Integer. Number of samples to simulate. Default is 100.}

\item{none_prop}{Numeric. Proportion of features with no covariate effect. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.5.}

\item{one_prop}{Numeric. Proportion of features driven by a single covariate effect. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.3.}

\item{multiple_prop}{Numeric. Proportion of features driven by multiple covariate effects. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.2.}

\item{shape1}{Numeric. First shape parameter for the Beta distribution used to generate baseline beta values. Default is 0.5.}

\item{shape2}{Numeric. Second shape parameter for the Beta distribution used to generate baseline beta values. Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{Beta}{A matrix of simulated methylation beta values (n_features x n_samples) adjusted for covariate effects.}
  \item{pheno}{A data frame of simulated phenotype data including covariates such as SampleID, Sex, Age, CellType, Mild1, Mild2, Mild3, and additional null covariates.}
  \item{categories}{A character vector indicating the effect category ("none", "single", or "multiple") assigned to each feature (CpG).}
}
}
\description{
This function simulates realistic DNA methylation beta values along with accompanying phenotype data.
It generates a phenotype data frame with various covariates including significant effects (e.g., Sex, Age, CellType),
mild effects (e.g., Mild1, Mild2, Mild3), and null covariates (e.g., Null1, Null2, Null3). A baseline beta matrix is 
created with values drawn from a Beta distribution, after which covariate effects are added to each feature (CpG) 
based on predefined proportions for no effect, a single effect, or multiple effects.
