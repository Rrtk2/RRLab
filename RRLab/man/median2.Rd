\usage{
median2(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric or factor vector. For numeric vectors, the function returns the median value. For factor vectors, 
the function returns the median level based on the level order or frequency distribution.}
}
\value{
The median value for numeric vectors or the median level for factor vectors.
}
\description{
This function calculates the median of a numeric vector or the median factor level of a factor vector.
For numeric vectors, it returns the standard median value, while for factor vectors, it calculates the median 
based on the level order or frequency distribution of the factor levels.
}
\examples{
# Example usage for numeric vector:
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
median2(numeric_vector)  # Should return 3

# Example usage for factor vector with an odd number of levels:
factor_vector <- factor(c("low", "medium", "high"), levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
median2(factor_vector)  # Should return "medium", middle number

# Example usage for factor vector with multiple occurrences of levels:
factor_vector <- factor(c("low", "low", "low", "low", "medium", "high", "high", "high", "high"), 
levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
median2(factor_vector)  # Based on middle number, should return "middle"

# Example usage for factor vector with skewed level distribution:
factor_vector <- factor(c("low", "low", "low", "low", "medium", "high"), 
levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
median2(factor_vector)  # Based on frequency, should return "low"
}
